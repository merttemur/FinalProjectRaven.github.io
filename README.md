# RAVEN - GPS-Independent Autonomous Navigation System

🚁 Revolutionary drone positioning system combining LIDAR, computer vision, and AI to enable safe operations in GPS-denied environments.

## 🌟 Project Overview

RAVEN (Resilient Autonomous Vehicle Enhanced Navigation) is a TED University Computer Engineering senior project that addresses the critical vulnerability of GPS-dependent UAV navigation systems. By integrating multi-sensor fusion with machine learning, RAVEN provides reliable positioning even when GPS signals are jammed or spoofed.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **GPS-Independent Navigation**: Complete autonomy without GPS dependency
- **Multi-Sensor Fusion**: Combines LIDAR, IMU, barometer, and computer vision
- **AI-Powered Positioning**: Deep learning for accurate location estimation
- **Real-Time Processing**: Instant position calculation and navigation
- **Jamming Resistant**: Immune to RF interference and GPS spoofing
- **Cost-Effective**: Open-source foundation with scalable architecture

## 🛠 Technology Stack

### Hardware Components
- **TF03 LIDAR**: High-precision terrain measurement
- **IMU Sensors**: 6-axis motion tracking
- **Barometer**: Accurate altitude sensing
- **HD Camera**: 100m altitude imagery

### Software & AI
- Deep Learning for position estimation
- Computer Vision for landmark recognition
- Sensor Fusion algorithms
- Real-time image processing

## 📋 Applications

### Defense & Security
- Resilient navigation in GPS-denied combat zones
- Protection against jamming and spoofing attacks
- Enhanced mission success and platform safety

### Civilian Use Cases
- Search and rescue in challenging terrain
- Forest, mine, and disaster zone operations
- Infrastructure inspection in remote areas
- Operations in GPS-limited environments

## 🚀 Deployment to GitHub Pages

### Quick Setup

1. **Create a GitHub Repository**
   ```bash
   # Initialize git repository (if not already done)
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: RAVEN project website"
   ```

2. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   # Add your remote repository
   git remote add origin https://github.com/merttemur/FinalProjectRaven.github.io.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Enable GitHub Pages**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Navigate to **Settings** > **Pages**
   - Under "Source", select **main** branch
   - Select **/ (root)** as the folder
   - Click **Save**
   - Your site will be published at: `https://merttemur.github.io/FinalProjectRaven.github.io/`

### Alternative: Deploy with GitHub Desktop

1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. Add the project folder as a new repository
3. Publish the repository to GitHub
4. Follow step 3 above to enable GitHub Pages
